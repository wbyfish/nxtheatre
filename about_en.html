                        [NXTheatre] respects the spirit of cross over and the originality very highly. With the core of a high-end magic theatre, it results constant collaboration and collision between different art forms; further, it transforms the performing space all together. By fixing the geographical location and the physical performing space, it continuously seeks for original and breaking-through possibilities in order to repositioning everything…
